# Policy Brief: Data-Protection Cryptocurrency 


### _Executive Summary_ *Preview*
There is an ongoing erosion of data-protection rights globally. Individual freedoms and livlihoods are at stake, as has been made evident by data breaches of cryptocurrency companies that reveal personal identifying information such as phone numbers and physical addresses of hundreds of thousands of people - effectively making their customers targets of cyber and real-world criminals. Meanwhile, with the rise of cryptocurrency and electronic financial transactions in general, government agencies have often pushed the financial services sector to implement strict surveillance and data retention policies, under the auspice of combatting terrorism and other illicit activities. This is despite minimal evidence that such measures prevent criminal or nefarious activities, and growing number of cases where cyber breaches of that data leave innocent people exposed and at risk of harm. 

While a sign of global adoption, these regulations toward cryptocurrency also carry new risk the world has never seen before - and is only beginning to comprehend. With cryptocurrency enabling individuals to store wealth absent of any bank or intermediaries, it has made these individuals prime targets for cyber and physical crime that can put their lives at very real risk. *When government regulations force companies and cryptocurrency service providers to adhere to data-retention policies that put citizens at risk, we have a significant societal problem on our hands that should be taken very seriously.*
